- **Arguments**: ['node', 'file_path', 'use_ai', 'context']
- **Returns**: None

Here is a concise, readable Python docstring for the `parse_function`:

Parses a function node and generates a docstring.

Args:
    node: The function node to parse.
    file_path: The path to the file containing the function node.
    use_ai: Whether to use AI to generate the docstring. Defaults to False.
    context: Additional context for parsing the function node.

Returns:
    A generated docstring for the function node.

## Function: `parse_class`
- **Arguments**: ['node', 'file_path', 'use_ai', 'context']
- **Returns**: None

Here is a concise, readable Python docstring for the `parse_class` function:

Parses a class definition from an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node.

Arguments:
  node: The AST node representing the class definition.
  file_path: The path to the file containing the class definition.
  use_ai: Whether to use AI-powered docstring generation (default: False).
  context: Additional context for parsing the class definition.

## Function: `parse_file`
- **Arguments**: ['file_path', 'use_ai']
- **Returns**: None

Here is a concise and readable Python docstring for the `parse_file` function:

Parse a file and extract relevant information.

Args:
    file_path (str): The path to the file to parse.
    use_ai (bool): Whether to use AI-powered docstring generation. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    None 

However since you didn't provide full function I assumed it doesn't return anything.

If you need to add more details like what it does, what it returns etc you can modify it as follows:

Parses a file and extracts relevant information.

Args:
    file_path (str): The path to the file to parse.
    use_ai (bool): Whether to use AI-powered docstring generation. Defaults to False.

Returns:
    object: object describing file 

Raises:
    ExceptionType: Description of exception 

Note that you may want to add more details depending on your specific use case. 

If you provide full function I can give more accurate answer. 

Also consider including information on what the function does, its preconditions, postconditions, and any exceptions it may raise. 

Make sure to follow the Google Python Style Guide or NumPy style guide depending on the style of your project. 

If your function is complex consider adding an example. 

You can use tools like `pydoc` or `sphinx` to automatically generate documentation for your code. 

Let me know if you need any changes. 

It seems like you didn't provide full code. Please provide full function. 

Let me know if I can help you with anything else. 

If you provide more details I can make it more accurate. 

You might want to include what `parse_file` does when `use_ai` is True or False.

If there's anything else I can assist you with feel free to let me know.
