# autodocgen/__main__.py

> **Summary**

This Python file serves as the entry point for the `autodocgen` command-line interface (CLI) tool. 

**Functionality**

When executed, the file:

1. Imports the `main` function from the `autodocgen.cli` module.
2. Checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported as a module).
3. Calls the `main` function, which likely starts the CLI tool.

**Inference**

The `autodocgen` tool is likely used to automatically generate documentation for Python projects. The specifics of its functionality are not defined in this file, but it is presumably handled within the `autodocgen.cli` module. 

**Example Use Case**

Running this Python file would execute the `autodocgen` CLI tool, allowing users to generate documentation for their Python projects using command-line arguments and options. 

No specific code changes or improvements can be suggested without more context about the `autodocgen` library.
