> **Summary of the Python File**

This Python file provides a set of functions for parsing Python files, extracting information such as functions, classes, docstrings, and arguments. The file uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module to analyze Python code.

**Main Functions**

1. **`parse_function`**: Parses a function from a given node in a Python file, extracting information such as function name, arguments, return type, and docstring.
2. **`parse_class`**: Parses a class from an AST node, extracting information such as class name, methods, and docstring.
3. **`parse_file`**: Parses a Python file using AST, extracting information such as functions, classes, docstrings, and arguments.
4. **`parse_python_files`**: Parses Python files in a specified directory, extracting functions, classes, and their corresponding docstrings and arguments.
5. **`group_functions_by_file`**: Groups functions by their defining file.

**Key Features**

* Uses AI-powered parsing (optional) to generate docstrings and file descriptions.
* Supports ignoring specific files or directories during parsing.
* Returns a structured representation of the parsed file contents.

**Usage**

The file can be used to analyze Python code and extract relevant information. For example, you can use the `parse_python_files` function to parse all Python files in a directory and extract their functions, classes, and docstrings.

## Function: `parse_function`
- **Arguments**: ['node', 'file_path', 'use_ai', 'context']
- **Returns**: None

### parse_function Docstring

Parses a function from a given node in a Python file.

### Parameters

* node: The node to parse, expected to represent a function definition.
* file_path: The path to the Python file being parsed.
* use_ai: A flag indicating whether to utilize AI for parsing or not.
* context: Additional context for parsing, potentially influencing how the function is processed.

### Returns 

None

## Function: `parse_class`
- **Arguments**: ['node', 'file_path', 'use_ai', 'context']
- **Returns**: None

Parses a class from an Abstract Syntax Tree node.

Args:
    node: The AST node representing the class.
    file_path: The path to the Python file being parsed.
    use_ai: A flag indicating whether to use AI-powered parsing.
    context: The parsing context.

Returns:
    A parsed representation of the class.


---


## Function: `parse_file`
- **Arguments**: ['file_path', 'use_ai']
- **Returns**: None

### parse_file Function Docstring

Parses a Python file using the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) module.

Extracts information such as functions, classes, docstrings, and arguments.

Args:
- file_path (str): The path to the Python file to be parsed.
- use_ai (bool): A flag indicating whether to utilize AI for parsing.

Returns:
- A structured representation of the parsed file contents.


---


## Function: `parse_python_files`
- **Arguments**: ['directory', 'use_ai', 'ignore']
- **Returns**: None

### parse_python_files

Parses Python files in a specified directory, extracting functions, classes, and their corresponding docstrings and arguments.

### Args

* directory: The path to the directory containing Python files to parse.
* use_ai: A flag indicating whether to utilize AI for parsing (not specified).
* ignore: A list or pattern of files or directories to ignore during parsing (not specified).

### Returns

Not specified. 

However, here is a suggested concise, readable Python docstring:

 
Parses Python files in a directory, extracting functions, classes, and their docstrings and arguments.

Args:
    directory (str): Path to the directory containing Python files to parse.
    use_ai (bool): Flag to utilize AI for parsing.
    ignore (list or str): Files or directories to ignore during parsing.

Returns:
    None

## Function: `group_functions_by_file`
- **Arguments**: ['functions']
- **Returns**: None

Group functions by their defining file.

### Args
* functions: A list of functions to group by file

### Returns
A dictionary where keys are file names and values are lists of functions defined in each file. 

However, since you requested a concise and readable Python docstring I assume you prefer the Google style.

### group_functions_by_file
## Args
functions (list): A list of functions to group by file
## Returns
dict: A dictionary where keys are file names and values are lists of functions defined in each file
