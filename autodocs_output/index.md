## [autodocgen/logger.py](autodocgen/logger.md)
  > **Simple Logger Class Summary**

This Python file defines a simple logging class called `SimpleLogger`. The class provides a basic logging functionality that writes log messages to both the console and a file.

**Key Features:**

* Creates a logger with a specified name (default: `'my_logger'`)
* Logs messages to both the console and a file (default file: `'app.log'`)
* Log level is set to `INFO`
* Log messages are formatted with a timestamp (`%(asctime)s`) followed by the message

**Usage:**

* Create an instance of the `SimpleLogger` class, optionally specifying a logger name and log file.
* Call the instance like a function, passing a message to be logged.

**Example:**
```python
logger = SimpleLogger('my_app', 'my_app.log')
logger('This is a log message')
```
This will output:
```
2023-12-01 12:00:00,000 - This is a log message
```
to both the console and the `my_app.log` file.

## [autodocgen/ai_docstring_generator.py](autodocgen/ai_docstring_generator.md)
  > This Python file is a documentation generator that uses the Groq AI API to create summaries and docstrings for Python files. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

### Main Features

1. **File Description Generation**: The `generate_file_description_ai` function takes a Python code snippet as input and uses the Groq AI API to generate a summary of what the code does.
2. **Docstring Generation**: The `generate_docstring` function generates a Python docstring for a given function, including its name, arguments, and optional file context.
3. **README Generation**: The `generate_readme_with_ai` function creates a README.md file for a Python project, including a project overview, module descriptions, and instructions on how to regenerate documentation.

### Workflow

1. The file loads environment variables, including a Groq API key.
2. It defines headers and API URLs for the Groq API.
3. The three main functions are defined:
	* `generate_file_description_ai`: generates a file summary using the Groq AI API.
	* `generate_docstring`: generates a docstring for a given function using the Groq AI API.
	* `generate_readme_with_ai`: generates a README.md file for a Python project using the Groq AI API.

### Usage

To use this file, you would:

1. Set up a Groq API key and store it in an environment variable (`GROQ_API_KEY`).
2. Import this file in your Python project.
3. Call one or more of the main functions to generate documentation.

For example:
```python
file_code = open('example.py', 'r').read()
file_summary = generate_file_description_ai(file_code)
print(file_summary)

docstring = generate_docstring('my_function', ['arg1', 'arg2'])
print(docstring)

readme = generate_readme_with_ai('/path/to/project', {'file1.py': 'summary1', 'file2.py': 'summary2'})
print(readme)
```

## [autodocgen/inject_docstrings.py](autodocgen/inject_docstrings.md)
  > **Python File Summary: Docstring Injector**

This Python file provides a tool for automatically injecting docstrings into Python code. The injector uses the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to parse the code, identify functions and classes, and add docstrings.

**Key Features:**

* **Docstring Generation**: The injector can generate docstrings for functions and classes using AI-powered tools (optional) or simple templates.
* **Custom Docstrings**: The injector allows providing custom docstrings for specific functions.
* **Diff Display**: The injector can display a unified diff between the original and modified code.

**Main Functionality:**

1. The `DocstringInjector` class takes in code, file context, and other options (force, show diff, in-memory functions).
2. It uses the AST to parse the code and visit functions and classes.
3. For each function or class, it checks if a docstring exists. If not, or if forced, it generates a docstring and adds it to the code.
4. The modified code is then returned or written to a file.

**Usage:**

The `inject_into_file` function is the main entry point. It takes in:

* `filepath`: The path to the Python file to inject docstrings into.
* `dest_path`: The destination path to write the modified code (optional).
* `force`: A flag to force docstring injection, even if existing docstrings are present.
* `show_diff`: A flag to display a unified diff between the original and modified code.
* `in_memory_funcs`: A list of custom functions with docstrings.

The function reads the file, creates a `DocstringInjector` instance, injects docstrings, and writes the modified code to the destination path. If `show_diff` is True, it displays the diff.

## [autodocgen/parser.py](autodocgen/parser.md)
  > **Python File Summary**

This Python file appears to be a code parser and analyzer for Python files. Its primary function is to extract information from Python files, including:

* Function and class definitions
* Function arguments and return types
* Docstrings (or generate them using AI if not present)
* File descriptions

The file provides the following functionality:

### Main Features

1. **Parsing Python Files**: The `parse_file` function reads a Python file, parses its abstract syntax tree (AST), and extracts information about functions and classes.
2. **Function and Class Analysis**: The `parse_function` and `parse_class` functions extract information about individual functions and classes, including their names, arguments, return types, and docstrings.
3. **AI-Powered Docstring Generation**: The file uses AI models (imported from `ai_docstring_generator`) to generate docstrings for functions and file descriptions if they are not present.
4. **Directory Scanning**: The `parse_python_files` function scans a directory and its subdirectories for Python files, parsing and analyzing each file.

### Output

The file returns a dictionary with the following structure:

* `grouped`: A dictionary where each key is a file path and the value is a list of parsed functions and classes.
* `file_descriptions`: A dictionary where each key is a file path and the value is a file description (either generated using AI or a default message).

### Utility Functions

The file also provides several utility functions, including:

* `should_ignore`: A function that checks if a path should be ignored based on a list of ignore paths.
* `group_functions_by_file`: A function that groups functions by their file paths.

Overall, this file seems to be part of a larger project that aims to analyze and understand Python codebases.

* `diff`: whether to show differences between original and modified files
* `ignore`: a list of directories to ignore

**Logging**

The tool uses a `SimpleLogger` class to log messages to a file named `autodocgen.log`. The logger is used to report errors, progress, and completion of tasks.

## [autodocgen/cli.py](autodocgen/cli.md)
  > **Python File Summary**

This Python file is the entry point for a command-line tool that generates documentation from Python source code. The tool supports two modes: CLI (Command-Line Interface) and GUI (Graphical User Interface).

### CLI Mode

The CLI mode allows users to generate documentation for a Python project by specifying the project directory, output directory, and other options. The available options are:

* `--path`: Path to the Python project directory (required)
* `--output-dir`: Directory to write the documentation (default: `docs`)
* `--fmt`: Output format (choices: `markdown`, `html`, default: `markdown`)
* `--use-ai`: Use AI to generate docstrings and file summaries
* `--pdf`: Export HTML docs to PDF
* `--readme`: Generate README.md for the project
* `--inject-docs`: Inject AI-generated docstrings into code
* `--inplace`: Modify original source files (DANGEROUS)
* `--force`: Force overwrite existing docstrings
* `--diff`: Show diff of injected docstrings
* `--ignore`: Folders to ignore (can be specified multiple times)

### GUI Mode

The GUI mode launches a graphical user interface for the tool.

### Main Functionality

The file uses the `argparse` library to parse command-line arguments and the `autodocgen` library to run the documentation tool. The main functionality of the file is to:

1. Parse command-line arguments
2. Check if the project directory exists
3. Create the output directory if it does not exist
4. Run the documentation tool with the specified options

### Example Usage

To use the tool in CLI mode, run the following command:
```bash
python autodocgen.py run --path /path/to/project --output-dir docs --fmt markdown --use-ai
```
To launch the GUI, run:
```bash
python autodocgen.py gui
```

## [autodocgen/__main__.py](autodocgen/__main__.md)
  > **Summary**

This Python file serves as the entry point for the `autodocgen` command-line interface (CLI) tool. 

**Functionality**

When executed, the file:

1. Imports the `main` function from the `autodocgen.cli` module.
2. Checks if the script is being run directly (not being imported as a module).
3. Calls the `main` function, which likely starts the CLI tool.

**Inference**

The `autodocgen` tool is likely used to automatically generate documentation for Python projects. The specifics of its functionality are not defined in this file, but it is presumably handled within the `autodocgen.cli` module. 

**Example Use Case**

Running this Python file would execute the `autodocgen` CLI tool, allowing users to generate documentation for their Python projects using command-line arguments and options. 

No specific code changes or improvements can be suggested without more context about the `autodocgen` library.
