# test_files/module1/math_utils.py

> **File Summary**

This Python file defines three simple mathematical functions:

1. **`add(a, b)`**: Returns the sum of two numbers `a` and `b`.
2. **`subtract(a, b)`**: Returns the difference between two numbers `a` and `b`.
3. **`multiply(a, b)`**: Returns the product of two numbers `a` and `b`.

These functions can be used to perform basic arithmetic operations. Note that there is no main function or execution code, so this file is likely intended to be imported as a module in another Python script. 

**Example Use Cases**

* Importing this module in another script to use the mathematical functions
* Using these functions as building blocks for more complex calculations

**Improvement Suggestions**

* Consider adding a docstring to the `subtract` function for consistency
* Adding a main function or example usage would make the file more executable and testable.
